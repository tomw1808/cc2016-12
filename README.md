# Craft-IT Coding Challenge

_Weekend, Dec 09 to Dec 11 2016_

__Receive €150 for a weekend of programming!__

_All_ the best selected submissions receive the money.

## Scope

The scope is to show basic understanding of MVC frameworks and API interaction with oAuth flows. This challenge requires you to know how to interact with APIs, from authentication to data retrieval.

The challenge this time is to create a very basic App that lists https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/friends/list for an authorized user.


## Rules
The following is a requirement:

* Use this directory as starting point
* When finished, publish your work somewhere on github
* Do it __on your own__ - this is not a group task
* and submit it __not later than Dec 11, 23:59:59__ and notify thomas@craft-it.co or add tomw1808 to your github/bitbucket!
* When your code is selected as one of the winners, you have to come in and prove it during a code review
* Be (at least) open to a fulltime/parttime position in our team. You receive the bounty no matter if you are really becoming a team-member or not.
* By participating you accept that sending out invitations on submissions is at Craft-IT’s solely discretion. No submissions will be accepted later than Sunday, Dec 11, 23:59:59 CET!

## Where to start / What to expect?

The challenge takes a seasoned developer around 1-2 hours of work, until a meaningful result is achieved. As you probably do not have any long-term experience with the zend-framework, a good starting point is to do [this tutorial](https://docs.zendframework.com/tutorials/getting-started/overview/).

You can use any other framework/library in addition, be it backend/frontend you want, as long as it fits inside the zend-framework 2 provided in this example repository.

You will _probably_ want to follow some flow like in this [Twitter oAuth Flow sample](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/how-to-authenticate-users-with-twitter-oauth-20--cms-25713).

We are looking into your code the following week/weeks and get back to you as soon as possible. We are all just humans here, so please add any documentation/instruction in a way that we understand it.

## Necessary Software

1. Install [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/)
2. Install [VirtualBox](https://www.virtualbox.org/)
3. Go to a shell/terminal/Cmd/gitbash and type `vagrant up` inside this directory.

And work with your favorite IDE inside the `./zend` directory.

Point your browser to [127.0.0.1:8080](http://127.0.0.1:8080) to get the output of ./zend/public.

type `vagrant ssh` to enter your virtual machine.

This diretory is mounted inside the virtual machine in `/vagrant`.

It will download quite some data, so make sure you are not on a capped connection. Also make sure nothing else is running on port 8080 or edit the Vagrantfile accordingly.
